# Hi there, I'm suljov! ðŸ‘‹
Im from Sweden currently studying IT Security technician/consultant.
Im also studying ethical hacking with goals to work as a penetreation tester and my ultimate goal is to work as a red teamer. 

I mostly use Github to take/make notes and cheat sheets for mostly myself but sharing it for everyone to help the community so enjoy!!
